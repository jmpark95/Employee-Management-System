# Some important business logic regarding leave requests

-  Annual leave accrues at 2.92 hours per 38 hr full time working week. Accrual starts on employee start date. Application automatically calculates this for the user, which they can see in their profile page
-  A full day of leave from 9 to 5:30 is 7.6 hours of annual leave(not 8.5). This is due a 1 hr unpaid lunch break + 7.6hr working day makes a 38 hour full time week.
-  The unpaid lunch break is between 12:30 and 1:30. This means:
-  Leave request from 9 to 12:30 = 3.5 hr leave
-  Leave request from 9 to 1:00 = 3.5 hr leave (same)
-  Leave request from 9 to 1:30 = 3.5 hr leave (same)
-  Leave request from 9 to 2:00 = 4 hr leave
-  Leave request from 9 to 2:30 = 4.5 hr leave
-  Leave request from 12:30 to 5:30 = 4 hr leave
-  Leave request from 1:30 to 5:30 = 4 hr leave (Leave has been requested after the lunch break)

Other

-  When HR creates an account for a new employee, password is initially set to their email. On first login, employee is prompted to reset password in order to access application
-  A trainee can only be a part of 1 class. When they are added to a class, they can no longer be a part of any other class - unless HR removes them and reassigns to another class
-  A trainer can teach many classes. Therefore, their names are not removed from the pool after being assigned to a class
